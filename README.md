RouteApp:
-----------------
RouteApp is created using [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) which is used for mobile Development.
This project is build using Ionic 2 and Angular 2 provided the [Routes API](https://github.com/Saleemahmh/Routes)
in GitHub.

Ionic Framework:
------------------

Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command line utility (the “CLI”), and use Cordova to build and deploy as a native app.
This means we need to install a few utilities to get developing.
The Ionic Framework enables the creation of cross platform mobile applications with HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript(Angular). Ionic 1 was built with Angular 1.*, and with Angular 2 recently released, 
the second major version of Ionic is also imminent.

This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myTabs tabs
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myTabs` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
